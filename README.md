This repository demonstrates a common yet subtle bug in TypeScript related to function overloading and type safety.  The `add` function is designed to add two numbers, but due to the lack of strict type checking in function overloading, it allows for unexpected input types leading to runtime errors.  The solution provides a more robust implementation that prevents this issue and demonstrates best practices for maintaining type safety in TypeScript functions.
